LPI CAW commands workaround for single argument commands not working, but no singletons working

_A - enter value in header (one output, so is it, do outputs one at a time)

[] and "" - enter [] or "" somewhere in header and use normal "="

not - can still use except for [], "", etc., see previous line

With no singletons working, CAWP is more stable than CAWMP
